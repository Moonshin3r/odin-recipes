# odin-recipes
This project aims to create a basic recipe list page using HTML and leverage Git for version control. By building this recipe page, I will showcase the following skills:

HTML knowledge I will be able to structure the recipe list using HTML elements like headings, lists, and paragraphs. 
Basic website building: I will demonstrate the ability to create a simple website layout to display the recipes in a user-friendly format.
Git version control: I will utilize Git commands to track changes made to the HTML code, allowing for easy rollbacks and collaboration. 

Through this project, I will gain practical experience in web development fundamentals and essential version control practices.
